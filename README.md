About
- This project is an AI chatbot application designed to demonstrate the integration of a backend AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, a custom API) with a sleek and user-friendly frontend. 
- The application allows users to send messages and receive AI-generated responses in a real-time chat interface. 
- The frontend is built with React for dynamic UI and Tailwind CSS for efficient and customizable styling.

Features
1. Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
2. Real-time Chat Interface: Displays user messages and AI responses dynamically.
3. Message Input: Clean and intuitive input field for sending messages.
4. Loading Indicators: Provides visual feedback when the AI is generating a response.
5. Scalable Architecture: Designed to easily integrate with different AI APIs.
6. Tailwind CSS: Fully customizable and component-driven styling.
7. Markdown Support (Optional): Render AI responses with basic Markdown formatting (e.g., bold, italics, code blocks).

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
Vite (or Create React App): For fast development and bundling. (Specify which one you used)
Axios (or Fetch API): For making HTTP requests to the AI backend.
Your AI API (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Custom API): The brain of your chatbot.

 Okay, here's a README file for your AI chatbot project using React and Tailwind CSS. I've included common sections you'd find in a good README, and you can customize it further with specific details about your bot's features and setup.
